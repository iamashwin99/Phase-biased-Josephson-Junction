## About

This repository contains simulation code to establish equivalence between the IcH and V H
(magnetoresistance) characteristics of a Josephson junction ( with and without the second harmonics), then further establish the experimental V H plot and
the simulated V H plot. These equivalences were used to support the results from the paper [arXiv:2304.11457](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11457).

For the first part, the simulation was set up by solving the ODE (wash board potential) with input similar to the experimental input of, sweeping the current while equilibrating the system at each step and then repeating this over multiple magnetic fields, then further analyzing this data to obtain IcHand V H plots. 

For the second part,
experimental data was gathered similarly to the simulation steps (calculating IV
data for multiple magnetic field ) and then analyzed to obtain IcH and V H plots, the results obtained from this was matched with the simulation results.
In both of the above method, the equivalence between the IcH and V H
(magnetoresistance) characteristics of a Josephson junction was confirmed and
was also matched with the experimental results.
